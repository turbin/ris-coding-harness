# Ponytail Audit — whole-repo over-engineering audit

Vendored from DietrichGebert/ponytail `skills/ponytail-audit` (MIT, upstream commit
`e3ba2aa`). `review.md`, repo-wide: scan the whole tree instead of a diff. Rank
findings biggest cut first. One-shot report, applies nothing.

## Tags

Same as `review.md`:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Hunt

Deps the stdlib or platform already ships, single-implementation interfaces,
factories with one product, wrappers that only delegate, files exporting one
thing, dead flags and config, hand-rolled stdlib.

## Output

One line per finding, ranked: `<tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>. [path]`.
End with `net: -<N> lines, -<M> deps possible.` Nothing to cut: `Lean already. Ship.`

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes, and
performance are out of scope — route them to a normal review pass. Lists findings,
applies nothing. One-shot.
